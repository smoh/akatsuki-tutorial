# Akatsuki tutorial

This repository contains a short tutorial on JAXA's Akatsuki mission, and how to use its data using python.

It was prepared for 2025 winter internship program at the Planetary Atmospheres Group (IBS).
The primary audience were undergraduate internship students from physics and
geoscience departments but the materials should be useful for anyone interested
in the Akatsuki data.

With marimo and pyodide, it runs in the browser and does not require any setup.
